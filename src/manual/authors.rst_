|re2c| was originally written by Peter Bumbulis (peter@csg.uwaterloo.ca) in 1993.
Marcus Boerger and Dan Nuffer spent several years to turn the original idea into
a production ready code generator. Since then it has been maintained and
developed by multiple volunteers, most notably,
Brian Young (bayoung@acm.org),
