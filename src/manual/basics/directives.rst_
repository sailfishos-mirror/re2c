Here is a full list of directives supported by |re2c|:


``!use:name ;``
    An in-block use directive that merges a previously defined rules block with
    the specified ``name`` into the current block. Named definitions, configurations
    and rules of the referenced block are added to the current ones. Conflicts
    between overlapping rules and configurations are resolved in the usual way:
    the first rule takes priority, and the latest configuration overrides the
    preceding ones. One exception is the special rules ``*``, ``$`` and ``<!>``
    for which a block-local definition always takes priority. A use directive
    can be placed anywhere inside of a block, and multiple use directives are
    allowed.

``!include file ;``
    This directive is the same as ``include`` block: it inserts ``file``
    contents verbatim in place of the directive.
